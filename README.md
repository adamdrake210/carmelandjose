# Wedding Website for Carmel And Jose

This is a website I built for my sister's wedding. This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app) and deployed to Now. I kept the design fairly simple and concentrated on functionality, speed and responsiveness across all devices.

## Tech Used

[Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)

[i18n](https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next) - For Translating between English and Spanish

[nProgress](https://github.com/rstacruz/nprogress) - Slim progress bars

[Next-Page-Transitions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-page-transitions)

[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)

## Deployed to Now

[now](https://zeit.co/now) offers a zero-configuration single-command deployment.

1.  Install the `now` command-line tool either via the recommended [desktop tool](https://zeit.co/download) or via node with `npm install -g now`.

2.  Run `now` from your project directory. You will see a **now.sh** URL in your output like this:

    ```
    > Ready! https://your-project-dirname-tpspyhtdtk.now.sh (copied to clipboard)
    ```

    Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app.

You can find more details about [`now` here](https://zeit.co/now).
