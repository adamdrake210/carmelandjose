  "para1": "The wedding ceremony and celebrations will take place at La Antigua Fábrica de Harinas, an old flourmill in the countryside on the Madrid/Guadalajara provincial border, around 60km from the centre of Madrid.",
  "para3": "The civil ceremony will last for around 30 minutes. It will be followed by a drinks and canapé reception and the wedding breakfast, in keeping with local tradition. For those of you who have not been to a Spanish wedding before, this means there will be lots of food and drink from the get-go. Be sure to pace yourselves and bear in mind that the sit down meal will comprise 3 courses. Later, there will be dancing and of course a free bar, which will be open until late.",
  "para4": "In line with British tradition, we will be having speeches, which will be delivered in a mixture of English and Spanish."
