  "para1": "The wedding ceremony and celebrations will take place at La Antigua Fábrica de Harinas, an old flourmill in the countryside on the Madrid/Guadalajara provincial border, around 60km from the centre of Madrid.",
  "para2": "We have taken the difficult decision to not invite any of your children to the wedding. We hope you will delight in the opportunity to leave your children at home for the weekend! But if you will be bringing them with you to Madrid and need help arranging childcare for the afternoon/evening of 6 June, then please let Carmel or Jose know as soon as possible.",
  "para3": "The civil ceremony will last for around 30 minutes. It will be followed by a drinks and canapé reception and the wedding breakfast, which will follow local tradition. For those of you who have not been to a Spanish wedding before, that means there will be lots of food and drink from the get-go. Be sure to pace yourselves and bear in mind that the sit down meal will comprise 3 courses. Later, there will be dancing and of course a free bar, which will be open until 5am.",
  "para4": "In line with British tradition, we will be having some speeches. Likely candidates to take the floor include the father of the bride, the bride, the groom and the Best Man. The speeches will be delivered in a mixture of English and Spanish. "
