  "para1": "In case you were wondering, women in Spain traditionally wear knee-length dresses with a fascinator or hat for early afternoon weddings and floor-length dresses for evening weddings. Since our wedding will start in the late afternoon, feel free to wear whatever length dress (or trousers, jumpsuit etc.) you prefer. Also, since neither of us are famous, no colours are prohibited - the brighter the better!",
  "para2": "If you feel the cold then please bring a pashmina or cardigan as we will be eating outside, weather permitting. We just want you to feel comfortable and be ready to party!",
